# Bamazon

README

Thank you for visiting my repository. This project uses Node.js, NPM, and MySQL to create dynamic command line interface (CLI) for a ficticious store named "Bamazon..the high-end Amazon". 

Here’s how it works:

    Initiate the customer side of the application by entering 'node bamazonCustomer.js' in the CLI.  Follow the prompts to make a sale.
    	You will be presented with a list of items available for sale.
    	Select an item to puchase.
    	Select the quantity.  If the quantity is available, the app will proceed; if not, you will be presented with an error message.
    	The app will sum your purchase

    Initiate the business side of the application by entering 'node bamazonManager.js' in the CLI.  Follow the prompts to display the reports.
    	You will be presented with a menu of the following reports:
    	View Products for Sale
    	View Low Inventory
    	Add Inventory
    	Add New Product
    	Exit Menu
     
This project is anyone who likes to shop!

Enjoy!
